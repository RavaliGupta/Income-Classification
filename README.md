# Income-Classification
Predicting the income class of individuals based on certain features.

In this projects,I collected some california Census Data and try to use various features of an individual to predict what class of income they belong in (>50k or <=50k). 
Data was first analysed to first identify the important features for classification using seaborn and matplotlib. Once important features are identified, they are converted to feature_columns to support the Estimator models.
I have used the Estimator API of Tensorflow to predict the Income class of each invidual. Along with that compared the results of the two models i.e,, Linear and Dense Neural Network.
