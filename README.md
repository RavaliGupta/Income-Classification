# Income-Classification
Predicting the income class of individuals based on certain features.

In this projects,I collected some california Census Data and try to use various features of an individual to predict what class of income they belogn in (>50k or <=50k). 
We have used the Estimator API of Tensorflow to predict the Income class of each invidual. Along with that compared the results of the two models i.e,, Linear and Dense Neural Network.
